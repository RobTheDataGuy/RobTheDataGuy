Working with data has always been a passion of mine. I studied Applied Statistics and Actuarial Science in school and then soon got into data analysis and data science.
From there, I have continued to try to learn as much as I can about data science, programming, and machine learning, etc. I am proud to be a life-long learner and look forward to continuing my learning in all things data.
